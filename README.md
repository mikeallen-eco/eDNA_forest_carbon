The purpose of this repository is to provide code and data for the manuscript: "eDNA offers opportunities for improved biodiversity monitoring within forest carbon markets" (Allen et al. 2024).

The repository consists of 4 data files and 1 R script that allow the user to reproduce the analyses and figures included in the paper. The data files are stored in the /data folder along with corresponding metadata text files describing the data set and the data contained in each column. The script file, summarize_eDNA_forest_carbon_lit.R, is subdivided into 12 sections (described in the Table of Contents within) and is set up such that all sections can run independently after Section 1 is run to load the packages and data. The 4 databases are formatted as tab-separated text files (.tsv files) and are described further below. 

1. eDNA_assessment_literature_database_20240923.tsv - data on each of the 324 scholarly articles reviewed in the paper related to using eDNA and related methods for environmental assessment.
2. FC_biodiversity_literature_database_20240923.tsv - data on each of the 72 scholarly articles reviewed in the paper related to forest carbon markets and biodiversity.
3. FC_projects_database_20240923.tsv - data on each of the 129 forest carbon projects reviewed in the paper that verified biodiversity co-benefits.
4. all_FC_projects_with_areas_database_20240923.tsv - a broader database of 1323 forest carbon projects identified, including those earlier in the verification pipeline and those that do not verify biodiversity co-benefits.
