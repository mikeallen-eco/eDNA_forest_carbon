### Metadata for the larger Forest Carbon project database with areas ###

This file provides metadata for the data file "all_FC_projects_with_areas_database_20240923.tsv". That database attempts to compile as complete a list of Forest Carbon (FC) projects as possible, and also to represent how much area they occupy. Full methods are described in Supplementary Note 1 of the manuscript: "eDNA offers opportunities for improved biodiversity monitoring within forest carbon markets" to be published in Communications Earth and Environment (Allen et al. 2024). Briefly, we downloaded raw project databases from the repository websites, filtered and combined them to include only (non-duplicated) forest projects, and added area information to each project manually by extracting this information from project documents. For projects without area information available, we imputed an area value using the average of a similar group of projects (e.g., same registry and same FC project type). Below is a list of the column names and a description of the data that each contains.

fcid - a unique project ID consisting of a verification program code and a project ID number. The program codes were: CCB = Climate, Community, and Biodiversity Alliance; GS = Gold Standard Impact Registry; SDV = Sustainable Development Verified Impact Standard; PV = PlanVivo; VCS = Verified Carbon Standard; ACR = American Carbon Registry; CAR = Climate Action Reserve. VCS was only listed as the program where the project was not also co-listed by CCB or SDV. The project ID number is the same as that used by the associated verification program, except for PlanVivo projects which were assigned unique numbers by us.

name - the name of the project as provided by the program

type - the forest carbon project type as provided by the program. Some projects are classified into more than one type and each program uses a slightly different notation. Refer to the respective program's website and documentation for more information about forest carbon project type definitions. Some projects lacked information on project type (e.g., PlanVivo projects that were earlier in the pipeline).

area_ha - the area of the forest carbon project in hectares. This represents the area of actual project activities (e.g., planting in Afforestation projects), not the broader 'project zone'. These values were obtained from the project documentation and have varying degrees of precision (see 'area_source' column). In cases where the value was converted to hectares from acres, this is noted in the "area_source" column.

imputed - was the area estimate imputed? (1 = yes; 0 = no). Imputed means the value was estimated as the average of the areas of similar projects (e.g., same registry and same FC project type). See Supplementary Note 1 of the manuscript for more details.

area_source - information about where the area estimate was sourced from. For CCB projects, the area estimate was often provided in a sidebar on each project's website, but did not always appear in the accompanying reports. Projects in earlier stages of the pipeline often represented projected values and generally had lower precision.
