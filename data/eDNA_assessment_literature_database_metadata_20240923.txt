### Metadata for eDNA literature database ###

This file provides metadata for the data file "eDNA_assessment_literature_database_20240923.tsv" which is a tab-delimited text file containing all 324 eDNA (and related techniques) reviewed in Allen et al. ("eDNA offers opportunities for improved biodiversity monitoring within forest carbon markets"). Each row in that file represents a scientific article in which eDNA (or a related approach) is used to evaluate an ecological impact or gradient. Below is a list of column names from that file and a description of the data that each column contains.

paperid - a unique identifier for each eDNA

authors - semicolon-separated list of authors for each paper

year - year that each paper was published

title - title of each paper

journal	- journal that each paper was published in

vol	- the volume number for the journal where article was published

num - the issue number for the journal where each article was published

pages - the page numbers for the journal where each article was published

article_num - the article number (where applicable) for each article

doi - the DOI for each article

region - the region of the world in which the study took place

country_area - the country or sub-region in which the study took place

trop_sub - did the study take place in tropical or sub-tropical latitudes? (1 = yes; 0 = no)

hab_gen - the general habitat of the study (marine, freshwater, forest, grassland, cave, other terrestrial)

substrate - the primary eDNA substrate (water, sediment, vegetation, etc.)

substrate2 - organismal group that served as the substrate where the substrate field was 'organism diet' or 'organism microbiome'

mammals - were mammals a focus of the study? (1 = yes; 0 = no)

birds - were birds a focus of the study? (1 = yes; 0 = no)

reptiles - were reptiles a focus of the study? (1 = yes; 0 = no)

amphibians - were amphibians a focus of the study? (1 = yes; 0 = no)

fish - were fish a focus of the study? (1 = yes; 0 = no)

invertebrates - were invertebrates a focus of the study? (1 = yes; 0 = no)

plants - were plants a focus of the study? (1 = yes; 0 = no)

fungi - were fungi a focus of the study? (1 = yes; 0 = no)

protists - were protists a focus of the study? (1 = yes; 0 = no)

prokaryotes - were prokaryotes a focus of the study? (1 = yes; 0 = no)

impact - the impact or gradient type studied (habitat structure, pollution, etc.)

method - molecular approach (DNA metabarcoding, RNA metabarcoding, qPCR, ddPCR, etc.)

markers - a list of the genetic regions targeted in the study

numregions - the number of genetic regions targeted in the study

numsamp - the total sample size of eDNA samples

numsamp_notes - notes explaining how sample size was determined (where ambiguous)

summary - a summary of the basic research question

lat_approx - the approximate latitude of the study

lon_approx - the approximate longitude of the study

geo_notes - notes explaining the choice of coordinates (where ambigous)

data_share - did the paper make the underlying raw or processed data (e.g., OTU tables) openly available? (1 = yes; 0 = no)

raw_data_archive - the name of the repository used for raw data (e.g., sequences) or 'N' where not made available

procdata_archive - the name of the repository used for processed data (e.g., OTU tables) or 'N' where not made available
